# Capstone-Project-Module-3- E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

Purpose:

The purpose of this document is to provide insights into understanding and predicting customer churn in the e-commerce domain using recall as a key metric.

Background:

Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical concern for e-commerce businesses. Understanding and predicting churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and maintain profitability.

Key Metric: Recall

Recall is a crucial metric in customer churn prediction. It measures the ability of a model to correctly identify churned customers out of all actual churned customers. In the context of e-commerce customer churn, recall indicates the proportion of churned customers that the model correctly identifies. A high recall indicates that the model is effective at capturing most of the customers who are likely to churn.

Importance of Recall:

In e-commerce, customer acquisition costs can be high, making it imperative to retain existing customers. Recall helps businesses identify and prioritize customers at risk of churn, allowing targeted retention strategies to be deployed. By maximizing recall, e-commerce businesses can minimize the number of churned customers slipping through undetected, thereby reducing revenue loss and maintaining customer loyalty.
